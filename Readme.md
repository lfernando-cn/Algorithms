# Algorithms from "Grokking Algorithms" Book

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms discussed in the book "Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People" by Aditya Bhargava. Each algorithm is implemented in different programming languages for educational purposes.

## List of Algorithms

- [Binary Search](https://github.com/lfernando-cn/Algorithms/blob/main/Binary_Search/src/App.java)
- [Selection Sort](https://github.com/lfernando-cn/Algorithms/blob/main/Selection_Sort/src/App.java)
- <!-- Add more as you implement -->

Each algorithm is implemented in different programming languages within its respective folder.

## Usage

To use any specific algorithm implementation, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory. Make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed for the programming language in which you wish to explore or run the algorithm.
